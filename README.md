## 🧠 Why This Project

SilvianaBotanica was created as a foundation for a long-term automation assistant.  
Instead of building a chaotic script, the goal was to design a bot that:

- Follows predictable, maintainable design patterns  
- Enforces clean code standards by default  
- Can evolve over time (plugins, services, persistence)  
- Demonstrates professional engineering discipline
